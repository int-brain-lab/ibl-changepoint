This folder will contain data downloaded from the IBL servers and saved as `.csv` files.
Execute the `fetch_data.ipynb` Python script to download and perform a simple preprocessing of the data. To do so, you will need IBL data access credentials.

The `.csv` file extension is in `.gitignore`, so downloaded and preprocessed data are not uploaded to GitHub.
